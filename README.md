# IDS for CAN

_IDS for CAN_ is an Android application capable of connecting to a standard ELM 327-type device via Bluetooth. The application monitors the CAN bus and uses an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect suspicious traffic indicative of an attack. When suspicious traffic is detected, an alert is generated.
